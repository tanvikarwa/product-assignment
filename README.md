# IMM, Web Development 1, Project
## Web Store: Design, Content & Responsive Styling

### Overview

In this project, you will be completing three (3) deliverables:

1. Responsive wireframe, design guide, and unique content
2. Styled website, suitable for small-width viewports
3. Completely responsive website


### Deliverables

#### Deliverable A: Planning, responsive wireframe and design guide (10%)
##### Due: Nov 13th, 2019, 3pm

Assess the given HTML starting project and plan a web page using the provided topic/theme. To begin, find multiple (3-5) inspiration websites that will be used as the basis for developing a content checklist and overall design guideline. This deliverable is part content, part a (light) design system for a web application (store).

Using the markup provided in `index.html` as the theme for the project, develop and submit:
- At least two "lo-fi" layout wireframes:
  - "mobile" (represents `320px` viewport)
  - *at least* one "desktop" layout
- Style guide (pdf, markdown, or html/css demo)
- Develop unique content for `index.html` (add new HTML where required)
  - Includes unique images and content
  - Suggestion: create a content list first

When creating a content list, consider *everything* a web store would require in terms of information **and** functionality. The site has the basics, but you will want to add additional content to complete the project.


#### Deliverable B: Styled website (small-width viewports only) (20%)
##### Due: Nov 20th, 2019, 3pm

Complete the initial styling for `index.html` using the base markup provided (with your revisions/additions from Deliverable A) as a starting point.

If required you may continue to modify HTML as needed to develop content for a page that (although non-functional and static) appears to be production ready.

You will be styling a layout for only the smallest viewport *(aka "mobile")*. The page will be graded in Google Chrome (both browser AND "device" mode) with testing in viewport widths ranging between 320px (minimum) and 639px (maximum). The site must be well structured when tested within all viewport sizes in that range. Content should remain fluid and fill the entire width of the viewport. 

Your styling (CSS) may include any/all properties learned in class (or beyond) for text/fonts and basic layouts. You will not be required to write `@media` queries as part of this deliverable.


#### Deliverable C: Complete responsive website (all viewport sizes) (20%)
##### Due: Nov 27th, 2019, 3pm

Complete the remaining style for this site using `@media` queries.

Site should:
- Pass w3c validation: <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input>
- Score green across all Google Chrome "Audit" metrics
